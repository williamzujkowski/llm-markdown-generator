## Technical Tutorial Prompt: {{ title | default('Step-by-Step Technical Guide') }}

Please write a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial about **{{ topic }}** for {{ audience | default('technical users') }}. The tutorial should be in Markdown format and provide practical, actionable guidance.

### Guidelines:

- Tone: {{ tone | default('clear, instructional, and approachable') }}
- Length: Aim for a detailed tutorial with at least 1000-1500 words
- Include code examples for each step, using proper markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting and line numbers where appropriate
- Structure the tutorial with clear, sequential headings (e.g., "Step 1: Setup Environment", "Step 2: Install Dependencies")
- Include a "Prerequisites" section with all required software versions and system requirements as a formatted table or checklist
- Add an "Environment Setup" section with platform-specific instructions (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Include "Troubleshooting" sections with formatted tables (Problem | Cause | Solution)
- Add "Key Concepts" callout boxes to explain important principles before diving into implementation
- Use diagrams or illustrations (described in markdown) to visualize complex processes

### Content Requirements:

- Start with a clear introduction explaining:
  - What readers will learn (with specific outcomes/deliverables)
  - Why it matters (practical applications and benefits)

- Break down the process into logical, sequential steps:
  - Number each main step clearly (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
  - Use consistent formatting for all steps
  - Include timestamps or progress indicators where appropriate
  - Mark optional steps clearly

- For each step:
  - Begin with a "Key Concept" box explaining the underlying principle
  - Explain the "why" before the "how"
  - Include complete code examples with line numbers and comments
  - Show expected outputs or results (formatted as console output)
  - Add warning boxes for potential pitfalls
  - Include checkpoints to validate progress

- Create a "Troubleshooting Guide" with:
  - Problem description
  - Common causes

- End with:
  - A summary of what was accomplished
  - Suggestions for next steps or further learning (with links)
  - Related tutorials or resources
  - A checklist of key points covered
  - Sample projects or exercises to reinforce learning
