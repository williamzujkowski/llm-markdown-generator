## Security Advisory Prompt: {{ title | default('High-Risk Vulnerability Report') }}

Please write a comprehensive security advisory report on **{{ topic }}** for {{ audience | default('security professionals and IT administrators') }}. The report should be in Markdown format and follow a structured format that provides actionable intelligence on high-risk vulnerabilities.

### Guidelines:

- Tone: {{ tone | default('authoritative, precise, and actionable') }}
- Length: Aim for a detailed report with around 1000-1500 words
- Structure the report with clear headings and subheadings
- Include CVE IDs, CVSS scores, and EPSS percentages where available
- Focus on vulnerabilities with CVSS scores â‰¥ 9.0 and high EPSS scores
- Emphasize actionable mitigations and recommendations
- Balance technical details with practical guidance

### Content Requirements:

- Begin with an executive summary that highlights key vulnerabilities and their significance
- Include a "Vulnerability Snapshot" section with formatted table-like structure for each CVE:
  - CVE ID (hyperlinked to https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-ID-HERE)
  - CVSS Score (including vector string hyperlinked to the CVSS calculator: https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#VECTOR-STRING-HERE)
  - EPSS Score (probability of exploitation, hyperlinked to EPSS dashboard if relevant)
  - CWE Category (hyperlinked to https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/CWE-ID-HERE.html)
  - Affected Software/Systems (with links to vendor resources where applicable)
  - Vulnerability Type (e.g., RCE, Privilege Escalation)
  - Patch Availability (hyperlinked to patch source if available)
  - Exploitation Status (Active, PoC Available, Theoretical, with links to relevant sources)
- Provide a technical deep dive for each vulnerability that includes:
  - Detailed vulnerability description
  - Attack vectors and exploitation techniques
  - Root cause analysis
  - System/application impact
- Include relevant proof-of-concept insights (without including actual exploit code)
- Assess known threat actor activity related to these vulnerabilities
- Include a comprehensive impact assessment covering:
  - Business impact
  - Operational impact
  - Data security implications
- Address cloud service provider implications if relevant
- Provide detailed mitigation and remediation steps, including:
  - Official patches and updates
  - Workarounds when patches aren't available
  - Configuration changes to reduce risk
  - Detection methods
- End with a concise conclusion summarizing key actions
- Include a references section with links to official advisories, original research, and tools
