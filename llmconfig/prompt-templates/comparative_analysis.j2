## Comparative Analysis Prompt: {{ title | default('Comprehensive Comparison') }}

Please write a thorough, balanced comparison of **{{ topic }}** for {{ audience | default('technical decision-makers') }}. The analysis should be in Markdown format and provide a detailed, side-by-side assessment of the alternatives.

### Guidelines:

- Use a consistent evaluation framework across all options
- Present balanced perspectives with evidence-based conclusions
- Avoid bias toward any particular option

### Content Requirements:

- Begin with a clear introduction explaining the purpose of the comparison
- Define the evaluation criteria explicitly
- For each criterion, provide:
  - A clear definition of what's being measured
  - The importance/relevance of this criterion
  - How each option performs against this measure
  - Supporting evidence or examples
- Use comparison tables to summarize key differences
- Include sections on:
  - Core features/capabilities
  - Performance characteristics
  - Implementation considerations
  - Cost factors (if applicable)
  - Ecosystem and community support
  - Future outlook and sustainability
- Address common migration or switching considerations
- Provide scenario-based recommendations (e.g., "Best for X type of project")
- End with a nuanced conclusion that acknowledges different use cases

### Keywords to incorporate:
{% for keyword in keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% if additional_keywords is defined %}
{% for keyword in additional_keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please generate a complete, publication-ready comparative analysis that helps readers make informed decisions between the options within {{ topic }}. The analysis should be comprehensive, fair, and acknowledge that different choices may be optimal for different requirements.
