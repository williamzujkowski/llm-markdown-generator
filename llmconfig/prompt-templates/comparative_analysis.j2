## Comparative Analysis Prompt: {{ title | default('Comprehensive Comparison') }}

Please write a thorough, balanced comparison of **{{ topic }}** for {{ audience | default('technical decision-makers') }}. The analysis should be in Markdown format and provide a detailed, side-by-side assessment of the alternatives.

### Guidelines:

- Tone: {{ tone | default('objective, analytical, and evidence-based') }}
- Length: Aim for a detailed analysis with at least 1000-1500 words
- Structure with clear headings, formatted comparison tables with alignment, and visual elements (described using markdown)
- Use a consistent, quantifiable evaluation framework with scoring metrics (e.g., 1-5 scale for each criterion)
- Present balanced perspectives with evidence-based conclusions supported by real-world data
- Avoid bias toward any particular option by acknowledging specific strengths/weaknesses objectively
- Format comparisons using both detailed prose analysis and at-a-glance visual elements (tables, lists, ratings)
- Include industry expert perspectives or consensus views where available (with attribution)
- Provide performance benchmarks or metrics with source citations where appropriate

### Content Requirements:

- Begin with a clear introduction explaining:
  - Purpose and scope of the comparison
  - Target audience and relevance
  - Methodology used for evaluation
  - Date of analysis and version details of each option (for currency)

- Define the evaluation criteria explicitly:
  - Organize criteria into categories (Performance, Usability, Cost, etc.)
  - Establish weighting for each criterion based on importance
  - Explain the scoring methodology and scale
  - Disclose any potential biases or limitations in the analysis

- For each criterion, provide:
  - A clear definition with measurement parameters
  - The importance/relevance with industry context
  - Quantitative metrics (when available) with sources
  - Qualitative assessment with expert justification
  - Direct comparison across all options in a standardized format
  - Supporting evidence with citations or links
  - Real-world examples demonstrating practical implications

- Create comprehensive comparison tables with:
  - Aligned columns with clear headers
  - Color-coded or symbol-based ratings for quick visual parsing
  - Primary features highlighted or emphasized
  - Footnotes for exceptions or clarifications
  - Consistent formatting and terminology across all options

- Include dedicated sections on:
  - Core features/capabilities with feature-by-feature comparison matrix
  - Performance characteristics with benchmarks and metrics
  - Implementation considerations including learning curve and integration complexity
  - Total cost of ownership analysis (initial, ongoing, hidden costs)
  - Ecosystem and community support metrics (community size, update frequency, third-party integrations)
  - Security and compliance features
  - Scalability and future-proofing considerations
  - Future outlook and sustainability (roadmap, company stability, etc.)

- Address migration or switching considerations:
  - Data migration complexity and tools
  - Learning curve and training needs
  - Compatibility with existing systems
  - Potential downtime or transition challenges
  - Cost of switching (both direct and indirect)

- Provide scenario-based recommendations:
  - Create detailed user personas or use case profiles
  - Map specific requirements to ideal options
  - Include decision flowcharts or matrices
  - Explicitly state "Best for X type of project" recommendations
  - Suggest hybrid approaches where appropriate

- End with:
  - A nuanced conclusion acknowledging different priorities
  - A weighted summary table of all criteria
  - Key differentiators highlighted for quick decision-making
  - Alternative options not covered in depth
  - Anticipated industry trends that may affect the comparison

### Keywords to incorporate:
{% for keyword in keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% if additional_keywords is defined %}
{% for keyword in additional_keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please generate a complete, publication-ready comparative analysis that helps readers make informed decisions between the options within {{ topic }}. The analysis should be comprehensive, fair, and acknowledge that different choices may be optimal for different requirements.
