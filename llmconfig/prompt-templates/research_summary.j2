## Research Summary Prompt: {{ title | default('Research Survey and Analysis') }}

Please write a comprehensive summary of current research on **{{ topic }}** for {{ audience | default('industry professionals and researchers') }}. The summary should be in Markdown format and provide a structured overview of recent advances, key findings, and future directions.

### Guidelines:

- Tone: {{ tone | default('academic, precise, and methodical') }}
- Length: Aim for a detailed summary with at least 1000-1500 words
- Structure with proper academic sections (Introduction, Methods, Findings, etc.)
- Use appropriate citation format when mentioning research
- Include tables or visual descriptions where helpful
- Maintain objectivity while identifying significant trends

### Content Requirements:

- Begin with a formal abstract formatted according to academic standards:
  - Problem statement and research significance 
  - Scope of the review (time period covered, inclusion/exclusion criteria)
  - Methodology of the literature review
  - Key findings summary
  - Implications and contributions
  - Keywords list formatted as academic papers typically present them

- Provide comprehensive historical context:
  - Timeline of major developments with dates in a formatted table
  - Seminal works and their impact (with citations in consistent format)
  - Evolution of theoretical frameworks over time
  - Paradigm shifts with clear before/after comparisons
  - Visual representation of the field's evolution if helpful

- Organize findings using academic structure:
  - Systematic categorization by sub-topics, methodologies, or chronology
  - Hierarchical organization of topics and subtopics
  - Use of consistent section numbering (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
  - Clear signposting and transitions between sections
  - Tables or matrices comparing different research threads

- For key research works, provide standardized summaries including:
  - Full citation in a consistent academic format (e.g., APA, IEEE)
  - Research questions or hypotheses quoted or precisely paraphrased
  - Methodological design details (participants, instruments, procedures)
  - Sample size and characteristics
  - Statistical approaches or qualitative methods used
  - Primary and secondary outcomes with effect sizes where applicable
  - Statistical significance and practical significance distinction
  - Key limitations explicitly noted by the researchers
  - Replication attempts and their results
  - Citations and impact metrics

- Create synthesis elements throughout:
  - Comparison tables for contradictory findings
  - Consensus statements with level of agreement indicated
  - Weight of evidence assessments for competing theories
  - Meta-analysis results if applicable (with forest plots described)
  - Visual mapping of interconnected research areas

- Highlight research breakthroughs with detailed analysis:
  - Before/after state of knowledge
  - Methodological innovations that enabled the breakthrough
  - Subsequent research building on the breakthrough
  - Real-world impact of the discovery
  - Recognition and awards in the field

- Include practical applications section:
  - Research-to-practice pipeline examples
  - Industry or policy implementations
  - Case studies of applied research
  - Technology transfer examples
  - Commercialization outcomes
  - Public engagement and communication

- Address methodological considerations:
  - Predominant research methods in the field with critique
  - Emerging methodological approaches
  - Reproducibility and replication challenges
  - Measurement issues and instrument validation
  - Statistical power and sample size considerations
  - Ethical considerations in the research area

- Present a formal research gaps analysis:
  - Systematic identification of understudied areas
  - Contradictory findings requiring resolution
  - Methodological limitations needing improvement
  - Populations or contexts with limited study
  - Theoretical questions remaining unanswered
  - Gap prioritization based on importance to field advancement

- Outline future research directions:
  - Near-term research opportunities with specific research questions
  - Long-term research agenda recommendations
  - Methodological innovations needed
  - Interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities
  - Funding priorities suggested by the literature
  - Testable hypotheses for future work

- Conclude with a comprehensive synthesis:
  - Current state of knowledge summary
  - Strength of evidence assessments
  - Theoretical framework evaluation
  - Progress assessment relative to field goals
  - Broader implications for related disciplines
  - Formatted references section with all cited works

### Keywords to incorporate:
{% for keyword in keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% if additional_keywords is defined %}
{% for keyword in additional_keywords %}
- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please generate a complete, publication-ready research summary that accurately represents the current state of knowledge on {{ topic }}. The summary should be thorough, balanced, and valuable to both those new to the field and established researchers.
